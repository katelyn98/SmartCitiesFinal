# SmartCitiesFinal
A gathering of code for my final project in CS1699: The Future of Cities taught by Dr. Stacy Wood at the University of Pittsburgh.
______

## Preliminary Research
I have included my PDF literature review/project proposal in the folder "Making the Use of Bike Share Systems...". Feel free to read my project proposal and literature review there. This is solely a proof of concept and used to demonstrate what concepts I learned relating to smart cities and technology throughout the class.

## UPDATE
In light of COVID-19 and missing a week of class/transitioning online, the project has
changed to be an analysis of the datasets coming out relating to COVID-19 and how they
impact the community or play a role in the development of a smart city.
